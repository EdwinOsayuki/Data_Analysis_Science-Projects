They don\\'t disappear,\" he told BBC News Online.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only reason blondes would disappear is if having the gene was a disadvantage and I do not think that is the case. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"The frequency of blondes may drop but they won\\'t disappear.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\n28 Mar 01\\xa0|\\xa0Education\\nWhat is it about blondes?\\n\\n\\n09 Apr 99\\xa0|\\xa0Health\\nPlatinum blondes are labelled as dumb\\n\\n\\n17 Apr 02\\xa0|\\xa0Health\\nHair dye cancer alert\\n\\n\\n\\nInternet links:\\nUniversity of Edinburgh\\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites\\n\\n\\nTop Health stories now:\\nHeart risk link to big families\\nBack pain drug \\'may aid diabetics\\'\\nCongo Ebola outbreak confirmed\\nVegetables ward off Alzheimer\\'s\\nPolio campaign launched in Iraq\\nGene defect explains high blood pressure\\nBotox \\'may cause new wrinkles\\'\\nAlien \\'abductees\\' show real symptoms\\n\\n\\nLinks to more Health stories are at the foot of the page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n E-mail this story to a friend\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks to more Health stories\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Section\\nHeart risk link to big families\\nBack pain drug \\'may aid diabetics\\'\\nCongo Ebola outbreak confirmed\\nVegetables ward off Alzheimer\\'s\\nPolio campaign launched in Iraq\\nGene defect explains high blood pressure\\nBotox \\'may cause new wrinkles\\'\\nAlien \\'abductees\\' show real symptoms\\nHow sperm wriggle\\nBollywood told to stub it out\\nFears over tuna health risk to babies\\nPublic can be taught to spot strokes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n^^  \\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews Front Page\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericas\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia-Pacific\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle East\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\nSouth Asia\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUK\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEntertainment\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScience/Nature\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\nTechnology\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking Point\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\nCountry Profiles\\r\\n\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Depth\\r\\n\\r\\n | \\r\\n\\nProgrammes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\n\\nTo BBC Sport>>\\r\\n |\\r\\n To BBC Weather>>\\r\\n |\\r\\n To BBC World Service>>\\r\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\n\\n© MMIII\\r\\n |\\r\\n News Sources\\r\\n |\\r\\n Privacy\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--\\r\\nvar pCid=\"uk_bbc_0\";\\r\\nvar w0=1;\\r\\nvar refR=escape(document.referrer);\\r\\nif (refR.length>=252) refR=refR.substring(0,252)+\"...\";\\r\\n//-->\\n<!--\\r\\nvar w0=0;\\r\\n//-->\\n\\n\\n<!--\\r\\nif(w0){\\r\\nvar imgN=\\'<img src=\"http://server-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/count?ref=\\'+\\r\\n\\trefR+\\'&cid=\\'+pCid+\\'\" width=1 height=1>\\';\\r\\nif(navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\\'Mac\\')!=-1){document.write(imgN);\\r\\n}else{\\r\\n\\tdocument.write(\\'<applet code=\"Measure.class\" \\'+\\r\\n\\t\\'codebase=\"http://server-uk.imrworldwide.com/\"\\'+\\'width=1 height=2>\\'+\\r\\n\\t\\'<param name=\"ref\" value=\"\\'+refR+\\'\">\\'+\\'<param name=\"cid\" value=\"\\'+pCid+\\r\\n\\t\\'\"><textflow>\\'+imgN+\\'</textflow></applet>\\');\\r\\n\\t}\\r\\n}\\r\\ndocument.write(\"<COMMENT>\");\\r\\n//-->\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tvar si = document.location+\"\";\\r\\n\\tvar tsi = si.replace(\".stm\",\"\").substr(si.length-11, si.length);\\r\\n\\tif (!tsi.match(/\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d/)) {tsi = 0;}\\r\\n\\tdocument.write(\\'<img src=\"http://stats.bbc.co.uk/o.gif?~RS~s~RS~News~RS~t~RS~HighWeb_Legacy~RS~i~RS~\\' + tsi + \\'~RS~p~RS~0~RS~u~RS~/2/hi/health/2284783.stm~RS~r~RS~(none)~RS~a~RS~International~RS~q~RS~~RS~z~RS~07~RS~\">\\');\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
